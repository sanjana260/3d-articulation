## Setup

This code repository is originally based on [Pointcept](https://github.com/Pointcept/Pointcept/blob/c4363c86e1e77325645d44bc8052b338031f1b30).

### Dependencies
Tested with CUDA 12.4, Python 3.11 and the dependencies in the lock file. Should probably also work with newer versions.
```bash
# make sure to load CUDA 12.4 beforehand
uv sync --python 3.11
```

### Data
Follow the instructions in the [original README](https://github.com/Pointcept/Pointcept/blob/c4363c86e1e77325645d44bc8052b338031f1b30/README.md) to setup the datasets. For ScanNet, the following command needs to be run afterwards as well.

```bash
python pointcept/datasets/preprocessing/scannet/prepare_2d_data/prepare_raw_data.py \
 --scannet_path $SCANNET_SCANS_PATH \
 --output_path data/processed/scannet_images
```

## Train

Refer to the [original README](https://github.com/Pointcept/Pointcept/blob/c4363c86e1e77325645d44bc8052b338031f1b30/README.md). The injection configs are generally named `semseg-pt-v3m1-0-image` and the distillation configs are named `distill-pt-v3m1-0-distill`.
They can be found in the respective `configs/$DATASET` folder.

For example, to train the injection model on the nuscenes dataset with 2 GPUs, run the following command:
```bash
sh scripts/train.sh -g 2 -d nuscenes -n $EXPERIMENT_NAME -c semseg-pt-v3m1-0-image
```

For distillation, the following command can be used:
```bash
sh scripts/train.sh -g 2 -d nuscenes -n $EXPERIMENT_NAME -c distill-pt-v3m1-0-distill
```

For fine-tuning a distilled model, the following command can be used:
```bash
sh scripts/train.sh -g 2 -d nuscenes -n $EXPERIMENT_NAME -c semseg-pt-v3m1-0-base -o "weight=exp/nuscenes/$DISTILL_EXPERIMENT_NAME/model/model_last.pth"
```
